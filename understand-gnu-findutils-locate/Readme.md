Why exploring findutils?

`locate` and `updatedb` are common tools that I use for day-to-day work. It's a linux userspace application which brings opportunity to delve deeper on linux.


Questions:

1. What is the data structure used for database file?



2. How database file is generated? 

3. How database file is consumed by `locate`?
