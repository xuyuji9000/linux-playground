# Introduction

This document tries to understand how bash script loads and execution happened in detail.

![execve()](./systemcall-execve.png)

## What does Unix loader do?

1. validation(permission, memory requirements etc.);

2. copying the program image from the disk into main memory;

3. copying the command-line arguments oon the stack;

4. initializing registers(e.g. the stack pointer);

5. jumping to the program entry point(_start).

## ELF format 

ELF's first 4 bytes is magic number.

Bash is represented by file signature `#!`.

## Unsolved problmes

- What happens when I execute a command in shell?

- Understand format used for execution on unix-like systems 
  This question for executable script is understanding how script runtime interpret the script

- What is execution context like?

- How execution context is setup based on executable file?

- How the program execution context is setup on Linux ?
