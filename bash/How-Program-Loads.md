# Introduction

This document tries to understand how bash script loads and execution happened in detail.

![execve()](./systemcall-execve.png)

## Steps involed in executing a bash script 

1. Shell itself is a process, new command execute within the context of shell

2. fork() get a PID with everything else stays the same

3. execve() keeps the new PID, clean the other state up(stack, program user space, etc)

4. Kernel hand control back to user space program


## ELF format 

ELF's first 4 bytes is magic number.

Bash is represented by file signature `#!`.

## Unsolved problmes

- What happens when I execute a command in shell?

- Understand format used for execution on unix-like systems 
  This question for executable script is understanding how script runtime interpret the script

- What is execution context like?

- How execution context is setup based on executable file?

- How the program execution context is setup on Linux ?

- What happens with shell initiation itself?
