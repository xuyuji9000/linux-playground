## Approaches of learning 

- Derive questions from execution, and try to find a answer to the question.

  Q: What is the boundry of digging into one topic?

  A: Do not have a clear answer yet, accumulated following steps for use for now:

    - Dig one level deeper to answer concerned topic

    - For questions deeper than the immediate lower level, understand the concepts and let go. 

    > The reasoning here is that, there is no repeated environment to sustain the knowledge.

## System Calls Examples

- [execve()](./systemcalls/execve/main.c)

  This system call is used for program loading
