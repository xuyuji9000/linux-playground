- Q: Why using Linux?

  A: Delegate my needs to a maintained stable base(like a book), then I only need to worry about the new things that are not maintained and how to read the book.
    
   And it feels similar to compare reading book and acquire random knowledge. Read book has the advantage of structured knowledge, low maintanence overhead(do need to know how the book structured).
