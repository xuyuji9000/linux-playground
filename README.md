## Approaches of learning 

- Derive questions from execution, and try to find a answer to the question.

Q: What is the boundry of digging into one topic?

A: Do not have a clear answer yet, but do need some process to regulate, so I can have a better use of time.

  - Dig one level deeper to answer the problem

  - For questions deeper than the immediate lower level, understand the concepts and let go. 

    > The reasoning here is that, there is no repeated environment to sustain the knowledge.

## System Calls Examples

- [execve()](./systemcalls/execve/main.c)

  This system call is used for program loading
